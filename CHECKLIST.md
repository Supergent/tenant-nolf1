## üöÄ Next Steps (To Run the App)

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Set Up Convex
```bash
# Login to Convex (opens browser)
npx convex login

# Initialize Convex project
npx convex dev --once
```

This will output:
- `CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .env.local.example .env.local

# Edit .env.local and add:
# 1. CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT and NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL (from step 2)
# 2. BETTER_AUTH_SECRET (generate with: openssl rand -base64 32)
# 3. OPENAI_API_KEY (from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
# 4. SITE_URL and NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL (http://localhost:3000 for dev)
```

### 4. Start Development
```bash
# Start both Convex and Next.js
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000

## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Authentication
- [ ] Sign up with email/password
- [ ] Sign in with existing account
- [ ] Sign out
- [ ] Authentication persists on reload

### Task Management
- [ ] Create task with title only
- [ ] Create task with full details (description, priority, due date)
- [ ] View all tasks
- [ ] Filter by status (To Do, In Progress, Completed)
- [ ] Toggle task completion
- [ ] Delete task
- [ ] View task statistics on dashboard
- [ ] Real-time updates when creating/updating tasks

### AI Assistant
- [ ] Navigate to /assistant
- [ ] Create new conversation thread
- [ ] Send message
- [ ] Receive AI response
- [ ] View conversation history
- [ ] Switch between threads
- [ ] Messages persist on reload

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Create 20+ tasks quickly (should see rate limit error)
- [ ] Send 10+ messages quickly (should see rate limit error)

### Responsiveness
- [ ] Test on mobile viewport
- [ ] Test on tablet viewport
- [ ] Test on desktop viewport

## üì¶ Architecture Verification

### Four-Layer Pattern
- [x] Database layer ONLY uses `ctx.db`
- [x] Endpoints compose database operations (never use `ctx.db`)
- [x] Helpers are pure functions (no `ctx` parameter)
- [x] Clear separation of concerns

### Security
- [x] Authentication on all endpoints
- [x] User ownership verification
- [x] Rate limiting on mutations
- [x] Input validation and sanitization
- [x] XSS prevention

### Best Practices
- [x] TypeScript strict mode
- [x] Proper error handling
- [x] User-scoped queries
- [x] Indexed database queries
- [x] Real-time reactivity
- [x] Component-based architecture

## üîç Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL is not set"
**Solution**: Make sure `.env.local` has `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` from `npx convex dev --once`

### Issue: "OPENAI_API_KEY not configured"
**Solution**: Add `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` to `.env.local`

### Issue: "Not authenticated" errors
**Solution**: Make sure you're signed in. Check Better Auth configuration in `convex/auth.ts`

### Issue: Rate limit errors
**Solution**: This is expected behavior. Wait 60 seconds or adjust limits in `convex/rateLimiter.ts`

### Issue: Type errors with `ctx.db.query()`
**Solution**: For dynamic table queries, use type assertion: `ctx.db.query(table as keyof DataModel)`
